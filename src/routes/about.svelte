          I've always been an artist. My first purpose in life was 'to become an
          artist'. I've had many other ambitions such as wanting to be a film
          director, architect etc. But fine art is my first love. However,
          growing up in the North East of England in a working class environment
          was not really conducive to this type of activity. I protested
          'learning a trade' by not doing anything.

          It wasn't until around 2011 that I picked up some canvasses, brushes
          and paints. Within 2 weeks I had done 12 paintings. These were
          described as 'naive', which was a fair point. At that time I had
          tapped into the aesthetic realms as was literally hounded with
          creative visions. Beacause of this I had to learn the technical side
          of creativity.

          I found one of the best academies in London,
          <a href="http://londonfineartstudios.com/" target="_blank">
            London Fine Art Studios
          </a>
          to gain these technical skills. I started with an evening foundation
          course, then enrolled on a few week long courses with
          <a href="http://www.henryyanart.com/" target="_blank">Henry Yan</a>
          and
          <a href="https://www.feliciaforte.com/" target="_blank">
            Felicia Forte
          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe art is a message, a beautiful message, that delivered
          expertly lifts the admirer into that aesthetic altitude.
