          I won't do a poncy third party description of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always been an artist. My first purpose in life was 'to become an
          artist'. I've had many others such as wanting to be a film director
          etc. But fine art is my first love. However, growing up in the North
          East of England in a working class environment was not really
          conducive to this type of activity. I protested 'learning a trade' by
          not doing anything.

          It wasn't until around 2011 that I picked up some canvasses, brushes
          and paints. Within 2 weeks I had done about 12 paintings. These were
          described as 'naive'; fair point. I had tapped into the aesthetic
          realms as was literally hounded with creative visions. However I had
          to learn the technical side of things. I believe art is a message, a
          beautiful message, that delivered expertly lifts the admirer into that
          aesthetic altitude.

          I have studied at London Fine Art Studios to gain these technical
          skills.
